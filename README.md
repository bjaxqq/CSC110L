# CSC110L
 
### Course Description
This course supplements the material from CSC110 by providing opportunities to practice and apply the skills and knowledge gained in CSC110.

### Course Objectives
Course Learning Outcomes (CLO): CSC110L shares the same objectives with CSC110.

### Course Grade
Registering for a course means that the student agrees to fulfill the requirements of that course, including spending time to complete all assignments. All assignments will be posted on Blackboard. Programming assignments are to be submitted electronically, via email. Other assignments must be submitted as doc or pdf files on Blackboard unless stated otherwise. Make every effort to submit assignments before their stated deadline, for full credit. Late work will be scored at the instructorâ€™s discretion. Start early and work consistently in order to complete each project on time. Problems with technology are no excuse for late projects.

Expect to complete twelve weeks of lab assignments, ten of which will individually contribute 10% of the course grade.

Programming projects will be graded on design, implementation and readability.

- Design (4/10): The following are some of the factors that contribute to a welldesigned program. The algorithms should be carefully thought out, and data used should be appropriate to the assigned task. For some programs, part of this grade will include a design statement, due before the program is due.
- Implementation (4/10): A program should accomplish the assigned task and should meet all requirements specified in the assignment. This may be accomplished by providing evidence that the program runs correctly. Even though formal methods may be used to verify the correctness of algorithms as they are designed, programs must be tested with data that provides sufficient evidence that they have been implemented correctly.
- Readability (2/10): A program should be clearly written. For example, it should make good use of named constants, have descriptive variable and function names, good comments, and appropriate spacing (indentation, spacing between separate sections, etc.)

Discussing projects with other students is appropriate and encouraged. It allows you to clarify you understanding and develop interpersonal skills. However, unless otherwise specified, each student is to design and implement each project independently. If you use someone else's code, it is considered plagiarism. Plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty are an extremely serious matter, and will not be tolerated. Incidents of academic dishonesty will be handled according to the Academic Integrity Policy in the Student Handbook.
